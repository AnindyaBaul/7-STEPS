 <h2>
    FOR MAKING A LIFE PLAN
 </h2>
 <p>
     <ul>
         <li>Life is abundant, and life is beautiful. And it’s a good place that we’re all in, you know, on this earth, if we take care of it.</li> <br>
         <li>
            Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don’t wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it’s at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored.
         </li> <br>
         <li>
            I think being in love with life is a key to eternal youth
         </li> <br>
         <li>
            Peace is the beauty of life. It is sunshine. It is the smile of a child, the love of a mother, the joy of a father, the togetherness of a family. It is the advancement of man, the victory of a just cause, the triumph of truth.
         </li> <br>
         <li>
            Life is full of beauty. Notice it. Notice the bumble bee, the small child, and the smiling faces. Smell the rain, and feel the wind. Live your life to the fullest potential, and fight for your dreams
         </li> <br>
         <li>
            Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them.
         </li> <br>
         <li>
            To be creative means to be in love with life. You can be creative only if you love life enough that you want to enhance its beauty, you want to bring a little more music to it, a little more poetry to it, a little more dance to it
         </li> <br>
     </ul>
